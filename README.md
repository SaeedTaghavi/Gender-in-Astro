# Gender in Astronomy Conferences
This repository is meant as a single point for data and analysis from the ongoing study of gender in astronomy conferences.

This project was started at [AAS 223 (2014)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3091), and a brief description is on [my website](http://jradavenport.github.io/2014/11/08/gender.html).


**If you are conducting the data-gathering survey at a conference, please submit a Pull Request with your data and/or results!**

If you would like to conduct the survey, we have an example of a [web form you can use](https://github.com/jradavenport/web-form) (PR's welcomed for improvements to this form als!)
